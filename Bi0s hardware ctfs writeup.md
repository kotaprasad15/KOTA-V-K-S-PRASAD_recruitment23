**Bi0s Hardware(Phase 1)**

**Writeup’s**

Challenge 1: Get-Wired 1

As I registered in bi0s hardware

when the wired CTF is conducted oﬄine, the hardware

team gave a welcome ﬂag for every parꢀcipant.

Challenge 2: Get-Wired 2

When they gave me the welcome ﬂag I

searched for the get-wired 2 ﬂag which is also a

welcome ﬂag that we have to search in the discord

server of bi0s.

Challenge 3: Achan’s Favourite

In this challenge, we have to search the

ﬂag which is Achan’s favourite.

The aꢁachment they gave was an audio ﬁle which is

in(.wav) format. Firstly I tried to decode that ﬁle using

some online websites. And I thought that it was a Morse

code and I thought to decode it into normal text. But the

ﬁle is not a Morse code. So I think and I tried so many

online websites on how to decode a .wav audio ﬁle.

But it didn’t happen and I tried chatgpt also but I didn’t

get it. Finally, I found a website which is academia.org in

which they gave that it is in spectrum form. I decoded

that ﬁle using the above-menꢀoned website and I got

the ﬂag.

Challenge 4: Dots and Dashes

Basically, it was an embedded task on

Morse code detecꢀon. The wiredcꢂ team will give a

hardware tool in which the Morse code will play and we

have to listen paꢀently to understand the Morse code.

The given device has to be connected to a laptop and

aꢃer connecꢀng the Morse code will play. In the ﬁrst

aꢁempt, I got a wrong ﬂag in which the ending of

sentences was correct but the middle part was wrong.

So, I tried again and I got the correct ﬂag. Finally, I got

the ﬁrst blood.

Challenge 5: Gate Reversing

It was an easy task. They gave an

aꢁachment in PNG format. The PNG photo as logic gates

connected. We have to try in diﬀerent ways to get an

output of 1. So, I tried many ways by inpuꢄng 1 and 0.

Finally, I got in my 5<sup>th</sup> aꢁempt. To do this task we have a

basic idea of logic gates.

Challenge 6: u\_4r7

It’s an embedded task. Firstly, they gave a

hardware tool which is UART and a logic analyzer. There

are many ports and we have to connect those ports to a

logic analyzer. These cables should be connected to the

laptop and a LOGIC app should be installed to do this

task. At one point when the wires are connected in a

correct way we will get a digital signal in the LOGIC app.

When we expand the digital signals we will get the ﬂag.

Challenge 7: Crypto Layers

It’s an easy task. They gave a code in binary

format which we have to decode into normal text. But

there are many steps in this task to do this. First, we

have to convert binary code into caeser cypher code and

then into vigener cypher and then into normal text then

we will get the ﬂag.

Challenge 8: Michael Paradise

It’s a very easy task. They gave a photo in

that photo there is a pic of a bridge. I uploaded that pic

in Google Lens and it said that it is a bridge in G TA V. So,

the bridge name was the ﬂag.

Challenge 9: The French Cipher

It’s an easy task to it. They gave a code that

we had to decode. We have to decode it from the caeser

cypher to normal text. So, I used a website to decode it

and they gave a hint that we have to use Vowels as key.

When the code has been decoded we will get the ﬂag.

Challenge 10: shoden

My approach to this task is ﬁrstly I have

searched shoden in chatgpt but I didn’t get any

informaꢀon about that. Aꢃer that, I searched shoden in

Google and I knew that it was a search engine.

I search CANADA on the website. It displayed many

servers so I went to the given informaꢀon in the bios



<a name="br4"></a> 

website and aꢃer that, I got the correct server. The

server is the ﬂag.

Challenge 11: Web sleuth

My approach to this task is I have read

the informaꢀon which is given by my bios team on their

website. In that informaꢀon, they gave me the name

Esteban Lavos and I searched on GitHub. By searching

for Esteban Lavos in GitHub I got an account by the given

name. In that account, there is informaꢀon that he has

the name Escobar Lavos and he said You can search me

on X(Twiꢁer). So, I searched on twiꢁer about him

searching I found the ﬂag.

Challenge 12: Find me

It’s a very easy task. The team bios gave

informaꢀon about this task A woman named called

Jenisha Harrison went on a solo trip but she hasn’t

returned. And there is no news about her. They gave a

hint that we could ﬁnd her if we checked her socials. So,

I started checking all social media apps like Facebook,

Instagram, X(Twiꢁer)etc. Finally, I found an account on

Instagram and she posted some pictures of her vacaꢀon

but I couldn’t ﬁnd the locaꢀon. By thinking I found one

of her posts that she kept an image of a socket board

and the company name is wriꢁen on that board. So, I

searched for the company on Google and I found the

country name.

Challenge 13: Wired shark

Undertook a challenge requiring analysis

of a .pcap ﬁle using Kali Linux. Used the Wireshark tool

to open and explore the ﬁle's contents. Encountered a

sequence of text within the ﬁle, including the phrase

"ﬂag-is-wireshark-is-cool. "Copied the text in the

expected ﬂag format and submiꢁed it for veriﬁcaꢀon.

Eager to learn more about Wireshark's funcꢀons in the

future.

Challenge 14: Lost within robots

It’s an embedded task in which we have

to connect the Arduino board to the system. Then we

have to connect to the Wi-Fi of **Lost within robots**. The

next part is that we have to search for the IP address of

this wiﬁ in the browser. Then a page will open and we

have to search for the ﬂag. So, I googled how to idenꢀfy

restricted or private areas of a site’s contents. Then it

said that we have to use **robots.txt**. We have to type the

robots.txt at the end of the URL. Then I found the ﬂag.

Challenge 15: Though not though

It’s an embedded task. In this task, we

have to do the Arduino connecꢀons properly to get the

ﬂag. In the given aꢁachment I solved the if-else logic to

ﬁnd the correct connecꢀons. So, then I put connecꢀons

in the Arduino board which I have got. Aꢃer connecꢀng

to the right one we will get the ﬂag.

Challenge 16: Ain’t no sunshine

It’s an embedded and easy task. They

gave us a circuit diagram and told us to build the circuit

according to the diagram. I built the circuit according to

the diagram ﬁrst I failed but the second ꢀme I got the

ﬂag.

Challenge 17: ESP-ionage

It’s an embedded task. We have to

connect the Arduino board to our system and connect to

the ESP-ionage Wi-Fi. Then, we have to paste the IPv4

address in browser.

-I remembered up to this part only. Aꢃer pasꢀng the Ip

address in browser I forgoꢁen the next part.

Challenge 18: Micropython

It’s an embedded task. We have to

connect the Arduino board to our system. For this task

we have to use Arduino ide app. In this app we have to

choose our board and connect to it. Then we have to

change the baud value and at some value the board will

respond correctly. Then, we have to use print command

to get the ﬂag.

Challenge 19: What’s up doh

Confronted a challenge similar to a

previous one involving a .pcap ﬁle. Iniꢀally followed the

same procedure but yielded no results. Noted a

reference to "idk567" in the challenge descripꢀon.



<a name="br7"></a> 

Resorted to Linux terminal commands to search for the

menꢀoned string in the .pcap ﬁle. Discovered "idk567"

as a website link, leading to a "Sponge Bob" image

containing the ﬂag. Successfully extracted the ﬂag by

inspecꢀng the website's content.

Challenge 20: CANtroll

Undertook a challenge related to CAN bus

communicaꢀon. Executed a command to install can-uꢀls

libraries. Referenced GitHub repositories for arbitraꢀon

ID informaꢀon. Uꢀlized vcan0 with diﬀerent packets to

uncover the ﬂag. Successfully obtained the ﬂag by

manipulaꢀng the can-uꢀls to bypass speed limits,

demonstraꢀng knowledge of CAN bus communicaꢀon.

Challenge 21: Firmware bin

Challenge 22: Simple web

I didn’t remember anything about the above two

challenges.
